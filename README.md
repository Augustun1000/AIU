# AIU

This is my custom automated Arch Linux installation
## Installation

```bash
  chmod 777 CD.sh
  ./CD.sh (For edit disk partitions)

  ./archinstall.sh (Select partitions, user name, password, bootloader, etc)
  chmod 777 BS.sh
  ./Bs.sh (Install base system programs)
  Finish
  In the binaries folder you can find "Suckless" programs compiled by me previously
  or compile them yourself if you wish.
```
